                <h1 class="main-title">A Simple Guide to Catan</h1>
                <p>Catan, pronounced kuh-tan, is a popular strategy board game released in 1995 where 
                players compete to develop a civilization on a fictional island. The game can be played 
                by three or four players, but can be played with up to six people with an additional 
                expansion pack.</p> 

                



                <div class="divider"></div>
                <h1 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h1>
                <p>Catan may be played with 3 or 4 people and usually takes around an hour to play. Once 
                    familiar, the game can be setup within 5 minutes creating a new
                    play experience with each successive game</p>

                <img src="images/board.jpg" alt="Catan Board" class="image-small" style="float: right"></img>
                <h2 id="setup">Setup</h1>
                <p>The game setup is relatively simple. Using the numbers on the interlocking joints, connect 
                    the 6 sea frame pieces like a puzzle. Shuffle the 19 terrain hexes and then place them on 
                    the board, starting from the edge, in a clockwise fashion. Flip the 18 circular token 
                    cards so that you may see the letter assigned to them. Now place the cards in alphabetical 
                    order on the center of each terrain hex in a similar clockwise fashion. Finally, flip the 
                    cards so that the numbers are shown. The setup is complete and the board has been randomized.</p>



                <h2 id="goal">Goal</h1>
                <p>The goal of Catan is to acquire 10 Victory Points (VPs). These points are awarded 
                to you through a number of ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Settlements: For each settlement you have in play, you get 1 VP. 
                        You may build up to five settlements for up to 5 VPs.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>Cities: For each city you have in play, you get 2 victory points. You may 
                        build up to four cities for up to 8 VPs.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>Victory Point Cards: You may purchase Development Cards from the shop which 
                        are similar to a lottery. These cards are random, but five of them are Victory Point 
                        Cards. Each Victory Point Card you have in your possession is worth 1 VP at the end 
                        of the game (when you have enough total VPs to win) 
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>Special Card - Largest Army: This card is obtained by maintaining the longest path
                         of roads on the board. A path meaning, from point a to point b, without backtracking. 
                         This card can be obtained once your road is five segments long and is worth 2 VPs, but 
                         there is only one. If a player builds a longer segment than the previously longest 
                         road, they take possession of the card. 
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>Special Card - Longest Road: This card is obtained by playing the Knight Card 
                        (another Development Card) the most times. There are fourteen Knight Cards in the 
                        Development Card deck. You must first play two Knight Cards to obtain this card. 
                        If a player plays one more than the previous max, they take possession of the card. 
                    </p></li>
                </ol>
                


                

                <div class="divider"></div>
                <img src="images/dice.jpg" alt="Catan Dice" class="image-small" style="float: right"></img>
                <h1 id="howtoplay">How to Play</h1>


                <h2 id="firstturn">First Turn</h1>
                <p>Every player will now roll the two included six-sided dice. The player with the highest 
                    number starts the game. The first turn however, is different from the rest. Each player
                     is given two settlements and two paths to start the game with. This turn, each player 
                     will choose a hex corner to place a settlement, as well as a segment to place one road.
                      Note, this road must connect to the settlement just placed. Upon placing their items, 
                      the turn proceeds in a clockwise fashion until the last player. This player may place
                       both their settlements and paths in that turn (as if they did the turn twice). Then,
                        the rotation flips and turns proceed until the last person goes (who should also be 
                        the first person who played). From here on, player one starts the round, and the 
                        turns proceed clockwise.  </p>

                <h2 id="buildingcosts">Building Costs</h1>
                <p><b>Road:</b> Roads must be placed on a segment (the line between two hexes) and must connect to 
                    one of your roads, settlements, or cities. Note the Longest Road special card that can 
                    be earned.</p>
                <img src="images/buildcosts.png" alt="Build Costs Card" class="image-small" style="float: right; width: 30%"></img>
                <p><b>Settlement: </b>Settlements may only be placed on a corner of a hex. This will connect the 
                    settlement to two or three adjacent hexes. Settlements must be placed two segments away 
                    from any other segment (regardless of who owns it) and must be connected to one of your 
                    roads. Settlements and cities produce material when the number assigned to them is 
                    rolled.</p>
                <p><b>City: </b> A city may be built to replace a currently in-play settlement. The settlement is 
                        simply taken off the board and replaced by the city. This will earn you double the 
                        resources from the adjacent hexes and put 2 VPs into play for you.</p>
                <p><b>Development Card:</b> The deck of 25 development cards acts like a lottery. 
                    A player may purchase a Development Card from the shop but may only play 
                    them on their next turn. </p>



                <h2 id="playing">Playing</h1>
                <p>On your turn, you must roll the dice. All players will collect the resources associated with the number rolled. 
                    Now the current player may build and trade with other players or the bank. Players 
                    may build and trade for as long as they can afford, though some players may opt to 
                    limit turns based on time. After completing a turn, pass the dice clockwise to the next player.</p>



                <h2 id="trading">Trading</h1>
                <p>Trades may be made with other players, though they can only be initiated by a player 
                    who just rolled. These trades are made in whatever manner the two players see fit, 
                    meaning it is very flexible how and what you trade.</p>
                <img src="images/resources.png" alt="Catan Resources" class="image-small" style="border-radius:  0; width: 75%; padding: 0%"></img>
                <p>By default however, you may only trade with the bank in a four-to-one manner (4:1). 
                    This means, you may trade four of the same resources, for any one resource of your 
                    choosing. If you settle on a harbor location (found at the edge of the playing area) 
                    players may observe that trade listed in the shop. For example, 3:1 ? means that the 
                    player may trade with the bank in a 3:1 manner with any resource. 2:1 (resource) means 
                    that the player may trade two of the resources listed for one other resource.</p>


                <h2 id="robber">The Robber and the Rule of Seven</h1>
                <p>The robber is initially placed on the desert tile. This is the only tile that does not 
                    yield resources and hence, does not require a circular number card. When a robber is 
                    placed on a hex, that hex can no longer yield resources for as long as it remains there. 
                    The robber is placed in two ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li style="overflow: auto">
                        <img src="images/robber.jpg" alt="Catan Robber" class="image-small" style="float: left"></img>
                        <p>If a seven is rolled (note that it is the most common combination) a series of events occur:</p>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman; padding-left: 20px">
                            <li><p>All players who have eight or more cards must give up half of their deck (rounding down). 
                                If you have 11 cards, you may give up only 5, for example.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The player who rolled the seven may choose to move the robber to a new hex.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The player who rolled the seven may choose to rob a player, as long as that player 
                                has a settlement or city that the robber blocks.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li style="overflow: auto">
                        <img src="images/knight.jpg" alt="Catan Robber" class="image-small" style="float: right"></img>
                        <p>If a knight card is played.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>The player who played the knight card may move the robber to a new hex.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The player who played the knight card may choose to rob a player, as long as that 
                                player has a settlement or city that the robber blocks.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Question: Which Catan expansion should I get?</p>
                        <p>There are many game sexpansions that can be purchased for Catan.
                            All of them offer many new features of gameplay which can spice up
                            the game for experienced players. A good start would be to get the 5-6
                            player expansion which simply expands the size of the current game. 
                            From there, you are welcome to research the expansions on your own 
                            and decide what you are most excited about.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Question: Will I ever understand Catan?</p>
                        <p>
                            Yes, of course. Catan may seem complicated at first glance but
                            after a couple of play-throughs it will feel natural and competitive.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Question: How can I get better at Catan?</p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately Catan is a luck-based game but you may notice that
                            a certain person in your group is always winning. How are they doing that?
                            Experience! Playing the game frequently provides insight on the decisions 
                            you make during a game. You may also benefit from watching better players 
                            compete in Catan. One of the most crucial aspects is trading with others!
                        </p>
